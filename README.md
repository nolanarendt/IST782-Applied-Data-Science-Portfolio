# Nolan Arendt's IST 782 Applied Data Science Portfolio

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of projects completed during my Master’s program at Syracuse University. These projects showcase my skills in data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. Each project demonstrates my ability to collect, store, and analyze data, generate actionable insights, and apply ethical data science practices. Below is an overview of the included projects and their respective details.

## Projects

### IST 652 - Scripting for Data Analysis

**Project:** Analyzing Viewer Voting Trends in Classic and Modern Cinema

**Description:** Developed a program to analyze movie review data focusing on viewer voting trends across genres, countries of origin, and demographics. Conducted extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to provide insights for production executives.

**Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

**Key Findings:**
- Drama and Comedy are the most popular genres.
- Positive sentiment in plot descriptions correlates with higher votes.
- Gender-based analysis showed women rated movies higher than men.

### IST 664 - Natural Language Processing

**Project:** Detection of Spam in Emails

**Description:** Explored machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or authentic using the Enron corpus. Compared several models, including Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

**Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas

**Key Findings:**
- Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting achieved the highest accuracy rates.
- Gradient Boosting demonstrated perfect precision in classifying ham emails.

### IST 687 - Introduction to Data Science

**Project:** Ames IA Housing Market Analysis: 2006-2010

**Description:** Analyzed the Ames, Iowa housing dataset to identify key features impacting the return on investment (ROI) for housing attributes. Conducted correlation and linear regression analyses to determine the most significant variables influencing sale prices.

**Technologies Used:** R, ggplot2, dplyr

**Key Findings:**
- Kitchen quality, basement height, and exterior quality were the most impactful factors on sale prices.
- Upgrading these features can significantly increase ROI for homebuyers and investors.

### IST 691 - Deep Learning in Practice

**Project:** Pistachio Type Classification

**Description:** Used Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images of pistachios into two species: Kirmizi and Siirt. Implemented data augmentation techniques and developed models using EfficientNetB0 and VGG16 architectures.

**Technologies Used:** Python, TensorFlow, Keras

**Key Findings:**
- EfficientNetB0 achieved a test accuracy of 98.46%.
- VGG16 provided a better balance between the two species.

### IST 707 - Applied Machine Learning

**Project:** Predicting COVID-19 Diagnosis

**Description:** Developed predictive models to determine the likelihood of a COVID-19 diagnosis based on reported symptoms and behavioral attributes. Explored classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

**Technologies Used:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas

**Key Findings:**
- Logistic Regression achieved the highest accuracy at approximately 83.63%.
- Highlighted the importance of handling class imbalances in datasets.
